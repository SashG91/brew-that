## Project Overview
Brew that is a mobile coffee station that can be found along popular cycling routes and aims to fuel cyclist during their social rides on the weekend.
The goal of this project was to showcase my understand of python essentials and allow for future opportunities once my skillset has improved.

- Include a recording of site that shows the terminal interaction.
  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loom-for-chrome/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb is a very intuitive and free tool to do a web recording.
- Then you can use https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-to-gif to convert the mp4 to a gif and just paste it into the readme via git hub and it'll resovle itself.
- Click on this link to view the deployed site link [Deployed url](https://brew-that.herokuapp.com/) 

## Table of Contents
GENERATE THIS LATER!!!

## How To Play/Use
Paragraph or bullet points of how the user initiates the program and interfaces with it. You could have videos of each bit if you want and ditact what the user should do.

## Features
This section includes both the implemented and future features associated with this project.

### Implemented Features

* Users are able to input their name to make their order personal.
* Users can add to their order or proceed to submit order.
* Users are able to see a total cost and order list once agreeing to their order.


### Future Features

* All program to distinguish between new and previous users.
* Allow exiting and new users to register using an email address to build a profile.
* Provide users with a credit balance according to their unique ID.


## Design Documents

Below is a diagram showing the intended logic of the terminal project. Areas marked in orange (registration of user) should be regarded as a future feature and is not included in this deployment.

## Data Model/ Classes
In this section write our your data model(s) or classes. 

You might want to include subsections that include how the data in the model is initialized and then the methods that you created to update it through the program.


You can create a table and take a screenshot, or you can write up subsections in markdown:

### Class X
To better group the game as an object, I wrote a class representing its properties and had method functions to update those properties: 

**Properties**
- property 1: is a {string} it represents {something} 
- property 2: is a {string} it represents {something} 

**Methods**
- **\_\_init\_\_**: Initialize method, it starts the class off with default parameters as if a user just started to play a game.
- **\_\_str\_\_**: Returns a string representation of the class/object

## Libraries used
* cachetools
    - Python module which provides various memoizing collections and decorators.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your features and ensure that they all work as intended in an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.


### Validation Testing
You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation.  In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

For each python file in your project, run it through the pep8online validator

- [PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/) include a screenshot of results

Note any errors or warnings you are ignoring and why. 

If the line is too long just add 
```$python 
# noqa
```
There is a space before the # and after it to skip the quality assurance for that line.

### Manual Testing

You can view manual testing for this project here: ADD LINK FOR GOOGLE SHEET!!

### Defect Tracking

Try to create issues in real time as it better reflects the daily life of a developer.

The easiest way to track defects is by using GITHUB's Issues to track these as it's really easy to copy/paste screenshots in and then write up how you closed them. At this stage you don't need a custom template or labels, that comes in P4.


### Defects of Note
Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and link to them directly here.


### Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found as long as:
- it does not impacting a user from completing a vital function on the website
- it only affects a very small subset of users
- is an extreme edge case that very few users would try

If you know of something that isn't quite right, create an issue and  link to it here and explain why you chose not to resolve it. 

Sometimes it's as simple, word wrapping issue that makes the site look odd at a certain screensize that you just didn't have time to fix due to the impending deadline and lack of skills. It's best to mention it but note why you allowed it to go live than let asccessors think you didn't notice it. 
### Commenting Code

Make sure you  use triple double quotes to document fuctions and classes.
 Here'a  documentation worthy example:
```$python
def yes_no(question):
    """
    Function to ask a simple yes no question of the user.
    :param question: String displayed as the question
    :return: answer: String equal to "1" or "2" representing yes or no respectfully
    """
    print(question)
    print("yes = 1")
    print("no = 2")
    answer = input("enter your answer here \n").strip()
    while answer not in ("1", "2"):
        print("please choose 1 for yes and 2 for no")
        answer = input("enter your answer here \n").strip()
    return answer

```

## Deployment

### Requirements
If the user is required to have certain keys and credentials you should include this section with diretions on how to get the necessary information.
ex)
1. **Google Account:** In order to have this program work, you need a google account. If you don't have one  [Create a google account](https://accounts.google.com/Signup)
2. **Google APIs**
    1. in a new incognito tab, log into your new google account.
    1. then update the url to be: https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started?pli=1 
        
        **GOOGLE DRIVE API Access**
        1.  create a new project for this, call it XXXXXX (You might want to refer to what you see in this video: https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LS101+2021_T1/courseware/293ee9d8ff3542d3b877137ed81b9a5b/071036790a5642f9a6f004f9888b6a45/ at the bottom of the screen to write out steps.)
        2. Then click on Add APIs and Services and select Libraries
        3. Search for Google Drive
        4. Click Enable
        5. Click Create Credentials
        6. Select Google Drive API from the drop down, Application Data, then no and click the Next Button
        7.  (https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-drive-api) 
        8. for service account details fill in a service account name ex) xxx_API, then click Create and Continue
        9. For the Accoun acces, select Role: Basic/Editor then continue
        10. Then Click Done
        11. Now select the newly created service account
        12. Click on the KEYS Tab
        13. Click Add Key
        14. Select JSON type (right click to show in folder so you know where the file was saved.
        
        **GOOGLE SHEETS API Access**
        You may need to us the back button get to the APIS & SErvices section from where you were.
        1. click the Libray  Tab and serarch for Google Sheets
        2. click enable

3. The downloaded credentialsJSON file is basically your creds.json file that you need to put into your heroku settings or gitpod environment to access your google drive.

4. Google Sheet Template
  - If you had to create specific sheets for your project, instruct users to make their own copy of it from yours and rename it back to what the python project expects
  - And don't forget to share the spreadsheet in question with the client_email from the creds.json 
### Gitpod
This section should describe the process someone would have to go through to get the local working in gitpod.  Such as install requirements.txt  and setting up a creds.json file that is in the gitignore and keeping their workspace.

If you have project settings required such as a creds.json file from the GOOGLE DRIVE API acess, please provide an example of that file in the writeup with the project key values:
```$python
{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "private_key_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "private_key": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "client_email": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "client_id": "<YOUR_VALUE>",
    "auth_uri": "https://accoutns.google.com/0/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cer_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "clien_x509_cert_url": "<YOUR_VALUE>"
}
```

If you have any dependencies, you should instruct users to install them
```$python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```



### Heroku
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to Heroku. Include screenshots if you think they would make the process easier.

You may want to re-watch the [python essentials deployment video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LS101+2021_T1/courseware/293ee9d8ff3542d3b877137ed81b9a5b/e3b664e16366444c8d722c5d8340b340/?child=first) when writing up this section.


If you have project settings required for Heroku, provide a table of the keys and values.
Do not share your personal keys but either cut them out of the screen shot or say <YOUR_VALUE> and include links on how the user would obtain such values.

#### Fork the repository
Make a fork so you have a copy of the repository in your own git hub account: https://github.com/maliahavlicek/portfolio_project_03

#### New Project
Log into Heroku and create a new project. Name it something like XXX_coders_bistro.


#### Settings
On the settings tab you have to address two things:
1. **Config Vars**

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/132135869-215d2e0f-805d-40a8-a8c2-fb1098e2645d.png)

  At a bar minimum you should show the user that they need to add the PORT. 8000 key value pair.


2. **Build Packs**

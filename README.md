## Project Overview
Brew That is a mobile coffee station that services popular cycling routes and aims to fuel cyclist during their social rides on the weekend. The idea is to provide a quick and streamlined way to get them fuelled and riding again.
The goal of this project was to showcase my understand of python essentials and allow for future opportunities once my skillset has improved.

- Below you can find the basic terminal interaction, this shows the interaction when all requirements are met from the user. Errors will be provided should invalid data be provided prompting the user to try again.

## How To Use
1. The user initiates the progamme and is presented with a welcome message and asked to provide their name.

2. The user is then presented with a drinks menu order options 1-6 and required to input a numeric value. Should the user input any other value they will be presented with the menu again (repeat order function).

4. Once the user chooses no, they will be taken to the total cost section that shows a summary of the order with the total cost.

* Allow frequent and new users to build a profile and make drink suggestions based on their past purchases.
* Provide users with a credit balance to make purchases.


## Design Documents

Below is a diagram showing the intended logic of the terminal project. Areas marked in orange (registration of user) should be regarded as a future feature and is not included in this deployment.

## Testing
Testing results using validators, manual (tables) have been provided below.

### Validation Testing
The pep8online validator was used to check the code for indentation and other generic errors. See results below.

### Defect Tracking

Try to create issues in real time as it better reflects the daily life of a developer.

The easiest way to track defects is by using GITHUB's Issues to track these as it's really easy to copy/paste screenshots in and then write up how you closed them. At this stage you don't need a custom template or labels, that comes in P4.


### Defects of Note
-Initializing the repeat order function to allow the users to add to their order.
-Printing a list of items that were selected by the user.
-Printing sales data to Googlesheets in the correct order, error with not using an array.


### Outstanding Defects
Below is a list of defect/s that were not resolved, but do not influence the core experience for the user.
- Removing the round brackets from the prices for each item when shown in the Total cost section.

## Deployment

### Heroku

This application was deployed via Heroku

- Log into Heroku.
- Navigate to Dashboard.
- Click "New" and select "create new app" from the drop-down menu. This is found in the upper right portion of the window. Provide a name for your application, this needs to be unique, and select your region.

- For Deployment there are two options, Automatic Deployments or Manual, I chose Automatic Deployment so Heroku will re-build each time code is pushed to GitHub.
- Ensure the correct branch is selected "master/Main", and select the deployment method that you desire.

### Gitpod
Before deploying, the Gitpod workspace needs the following setup steps for Heroku to build the project:

1. Install the dependencies for Heroku using the following instruction to the terminal:
```$python
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
